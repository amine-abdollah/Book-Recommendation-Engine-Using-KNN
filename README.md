# Book-Recommendation-Engine-Using-KNN

This project Included in Machine Learning with Python present creating a book recommendation algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors

I was able to use the Book-Crossings dataset which was provided and created a impressively accurate book recommendation engine. This dataset contains 1.1 million ratings (scale of 1-10) of 270,000 books by 90,000 users.

## Project Instructions

In this challenge, The goal is to create a book recommendation algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors.

the project will use the Book-Crossings dataset. This dataset contains 1.1 million ratings (scale of 1-10) of 270,000 books by 90,000 users.

After importing and cleaning the data,  NearestNeighbors from sklearn.neighbors should be used to develop a model that shows books that are similar to a given book. The Nearest Neighbors algorithm measures the distance to determine the “closeness” of instances.

the main tast is to create a function named get_recommends that takes a book title (from the dataset) as an argument and returns a list of 5 similar books with their distances from the book argument.
